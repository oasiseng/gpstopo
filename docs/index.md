# GPSTopo Codex Overview

The GPSTopo Codex is an open reference for the operational standards, tools, and
quality controls that guide our mapping and site data services. It captures
repeatable workflows, documentation templates, and integration recipes so that
teams can reproduce our practices or adapt them for their own geospatial
operations.

Use this section to discover the foundational documents:

- [quality-control.md](quality-control.md) — Review and approval process for all deliverables.
- [data-processing.md](data-processing.md) — Procedures for ingesting, cleaning, and exporting geospatial datasets.
- [field-ops.md](field-ops.md) — Field collection checklists, safety rules, and naming conventions.
- [client-delivery.md](client-delivery.md) — Packaging standards and metadata expectations for client handoffs.
- [file-standards.md](file-standards.md) — Version control rules for CAD, imagery, and reports.
- [code-of-conduct.md](code-of-conduct.md) — Expectations for respectful and inclusive collaboration.
- [glossary.md](glossary.md) — Definitions for key GPSTopo and industry terminology.

For additional assets, see the `templates/`, `flowcharts/`, and `systems/`
directories at the repository root.
