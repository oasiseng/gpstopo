# ALTA/NSPS Survey QC Plan

## Purpose & scope

Coordinate nationwide ALTA/NSPS Land Title Surveys delivered through GPSTopo's licensed PLS network. QC ensures every map satisfies the 2021 Minimum Standard Detail Requirements, contracted Table A items, and lender-specific certification wording.

## Governing standards & references

- **ALTA/NSPS Minimum Standard Detail Requirements (effective Feb 23, 2021).**
- State statutes governing boundary and title surveys (use project jurisdiction).
- Title commitment (Schedule A/B); recorded documents referenced therein.
- Client-selected Table A items and lender instructions.
- GPSTopo QC workflow (process_qc_review.md) for review gating.

## Roles & sign-offs

| Stage | Owner | QC gate |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Proposal & Table A scope | PM + Client | Signed scope + Table A checklist |
| Field & boundary resolution | Local PLS partner | Daily coordination log + control verification |
| Drafting & compilation | Partner drafting team | Internal partner QC + file transfer |
| GPSTopo technical QC | Internal QC Lead (PLS) | Checklist + certification text review |
| Delivery | PM + Internal PLS | Upload to client portal + notification to title/lender |

## QC workflow

### 1. Pre-field coordination
- Obtain current title commitment, easements, and adjoining deeds; log document numbers.
- Finalize Table A selections (items 1–21) in writing with client and lender.
- Assign licensed PLS with jurisdictional authority; confirm insurance and licensure status.
- Prepare project briefing packet (control, scope, deliverable formats, contact list) for field partner.

### 2. Field & boundary resolution
- Field crew locates monuments, improvements, utilities (per Table A 11), and evidence of possession.
- Perform closed traverse or GNSS control achieving minimum 1:10,000 closure.
- Document utility coordination (811 responses, utility maps) when Table A 11/13 are requested.
- Maintain daily field notes available for GPSTopo review.

### 3. Drafting & compilation
- Compile boundary, easements, improvements, flood data, zoning info (Table A 6/7).
- Ensure legend contains all symbology; include north arrow, scale, vicinity map.
- Complete ALTA certification paragraph with correct parties (insured, client, lender).
- Export layered CAD (DWG) and plotting PDF using GPSTopo title block.

### 4. GPSTopo QC review
- Run ALTA checklist:
  - [ ] Survey date, record dates, and map date populated.
  - [ ] Title commitment schedule references match mapping.
  - [ ] Table A items satisfied or explicitly noted as excluded.
  - [ ] Flood zone, zoning, setback, and building data included when requested.
  - [ ] Signature/seal blocks comply with state requirements.
- Validate dimensions, bearings, and area with independent closure computation.
- Review depiction of encroachments, easements, and notes for clarity.

### 5. Delivery & archiving
- Deliver sealed PDF, DWG, and supporting documents (title commitment, Table A checklist, utility responses) to client portal.
- Provide lender-specific digital signature if required (e.g., DocuSign with seal).
- Archive raw data, field notes, QC checklist, and correspondence for minimum 10 years or statutory requirement.

## Accuracy & tolerance targets

| Element | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| Traverse closure | ≥1:10,000 (per ALTA minimum) |
| Positional tolerance | ±0.07 ft + 50 ppm (per ALTA precision) |
| Monument ties | Two independent measurements each |
| Utility depiction | Note source and quality level (ASCE 38) when applicable |

## Stage checklists

### Intake
- [ ] Title commitment (Schedule A/B) on file.
- [ ] Table A checklist signed by client.
- [ ] PLS assignment confirmed with license verification.
- [ ] Insurance certificates logged.

### Field
- [ ] Control report uploaded (traverse, GNSS).
- [ ] Photos of critical monuments collected.
- [ ] Utility responses stored.
- [ ] Field notes legible and indexed.

### Drafting/QC
- [ ] Closure report attached.
- [ ] Certification paragraph matches contracting parties.
- [ ] Table A matrix attached to deliverable.
- [ ] Seal/signature validated.

## Nonconformance handling

- **Missing Table A items:** Pause delivery; coordinate with partner to collect required data or obtain written waiver from client/lender.
- **Certification errors:** Issue corrected survey with revision letter; notify all recipients.
- **Boundary discrepancies:** Escalate immediately to supervising PLS; do not transmit deliverable until resolved and documented.
- Maintain ALTA-specific metrics (cycle time, rework rate, partner score) for quarterly reviews.
