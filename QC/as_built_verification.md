# As-Built Verification QC Plan

## Purpose & scope

Document constructed conditions (grading, drainage, structural elevations, utilities) to demonstrate compliance with design documents, permits, and close-out requirements. QC focuses on comparing field-measured data against approved plans and ensuring certifications meet jurisdictional standards.

## Governing standards & references

- FEMA Elevation Certificate & Instructions (if floodplain compliance is requested).
- International Building Code (current edition) and local amendments governing final surveys.
- ASCE 7 design criteria reference for critical elevations (when required).
- State PLS/PE board requirements for as-built certifications and signatures.

## Roles & sign-offs

| Stage | Owner | QC gate |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Scope confirmation | PM + Client | Required elements & tolerances documented |
| Field verification | Field Partner | Daily comparison to design benchmarks |
| Drafting & variance analysis | Drafter/Engineer | Variance table completed |
| QC review | PLS/PE reviewer | Certification block + signoff |
| Delivery | PM | Submission package and client notification |

## QC workflow

### 1. Pre-field intake
- Collect final issued drawings, permit conditions, and punch list items.
- Define required measurements (FFEs, pad grades, utilities, ADA slopes, drainage structures).
- Establish acceptance tolerances (e.g., ±0.10 ft for FFEs, 2% max for ADA slopes) and whether deviations require redesign approval.
- Confirm need for PLS stamp, PE letter, or both.

### 2. Field verification
- Occupy permanent control from construction layout or establish new benchmarks tied to project datum.
- Measure critical points with redundant observations; for slopes, collect station intervals ≤10 ft.
- Capture photo evidence for key features (e.g., drainage inlets, retaining walls).
- Immediately flag any deviation beyond tolerance to PM before leaving site.

### 3. Drafting & variance analysis
- Update CAD with as-built geometry using distinct symbology from design (per process_qc_review guidelines).
- Create variance table summarizing design vs. measured values, tolerance, and pass/fail.
- Note any corrective actions requested by AHJ or client.
- Prepare certification text referencing applicable codes/permits.

### 4. QC review
- Reviewer verifies control references, variance calculations, and annotations.
- Confirm certification block includes license number, expiration, and contact per jurisdiction.
- Ensure deliverable clearly distinguishes design vs. as-built (line types, colors, legend).
- Verify supporting documents (photos, inspection forms) are cataloged.

### 5. Delivery & retention
- Package PDF/DWG, variance table, certification letter, photos, and metadata sheet.
- Transmit to client/AHJ; document submission method (portal upload, email, print).
- Archive QC checklist, raw data, and certification backups for minimum 7 years or longer if statute dictates.

## Accuracy & tolerance targets

| Element | Target |
|---------|--------|
| Finished floor elevations | ±0.10 ft (tighten if permit requires) |
| Grading slopes | ±0.5% absolute difference vs. design; ADA slopes ≤2% cross, ≤5% running |
| Utility inverts | ±0.05 ft |
| Structural offsets | ±0.05 ft horizontal |

## Stage checklists

### Intake
- [ ] Latest approved drawings & permit conditions in project folder.
- [ ] Required certification text confirmed.
- [ ] Tolerances logged in intake form.
- [ ] Control references verified.

### Field
- [ ] Benchmarks observed and closure recorded.
- [ ] Redundant shots on critical items.
- [ ] Photos captured and named per convention.
- [ ] Deviations beyond tolerance reported same day.

### Drafting/QC
- [ ] Variance table complete.
- [ ] As-built symbology differentiates design.
- [ ] Certification block reviewed by PLS/PE.
- [ ] Deliverables cross-checked to requirements.

## Nonconformance handling

- **Variance beyond tolerance:** Document in variance table, notify client, and await disposition (accept as-is, rework, or revision). Do not issue certificate showing compliance if tolerance exceeded without approval.
- **Missing data:** Schedule supplemental field visit; mark deliverable `On Hold – Incomplete Data`.
- **Certification errors:** Treat as critical defect; retract deliverable, issue corrected letter, and log incident with QA metrics.
- Maintain corrective action log referencing project ID, defect type, responsible party, and resolution date.
