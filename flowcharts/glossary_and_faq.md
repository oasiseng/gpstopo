A: Usually not. We just need access to the property. We'll coordinate timing with you.

**Q: What file formats will I receive?**  
A: Standard delivery includes PDF (for viewing/printing) and DWG (for CAD editing). Additional formats available on request.

**Q: Is this a "real" survey?**  
A: Our topographic and boundary maps are prepared by or verified by licensed professionals. For legal boundary determination or ALTA surveys, we use our licensed PLS network. All deliverables include appropriate disclaimers about their intended use.

**Q: What if I need changes after delivery?**  
A: One free revision is included if the issue is within the original scope. Additional changes may incur a fee.

**Q: Can I use this for a building permit?**

### For Team Members

**Q: How do we handle rush orders?**  
A: Rush orders get priority assignment (partners with <2 active projects). Increased payout helps incentivize faster turnaround.

**Q: What if a client is unhappy with deliverable?**  
A: First, review against original scope and QC checklist. If legitimate issue, offer free revision. If out-of-scope request, quote additional work. Escalate to founders if needed.

**Q: How do we track project status?**  
A: All projects tracked in Airtable/Trello. Status updates trigger automatic client notifications. Check board daily for any stuck projects.

**Q: What's our refund policy?**  
A: Full refund if requested before field work begins. After work started, case-by-case basis (typically 50% refund or free revision option).

**Q: How do we onboard new partners?**  
A: 1) Verify license/credentials, 2) Add to partner database, 3) Assign test project with extra QC, 4) Review performance before full integration.
