## 💡 Documentation Philosophy

> "If it's not documented, it doesn't exist. If it's not automated, it's not scalable."

These docs serve as the **single source of truth** for how GPSTopo operates. When processes change, update the docs first, then implement the changes.

**Documentation Principles:**
1. **Visual First** — Use Mermaid diagrams whenever possible
2. **Actionable** — Every doc should have clear next steps
3. **Maintained** — Outdated docs are worse than no docs
4. **Transparent** — Most of this can be public (GitHub Codex)
5. **Lean** — Keep it simple and easy to update
