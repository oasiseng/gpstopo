# Flowchart Library

Binary diagram files were removed to keep the repository lightweight and compatible with the no-binary policy. Use the guidance below to access or regenerate each flowchart.

## Client Workflow
- **Location:** Store the latest version in the internal knowledge base (e.g., Notion or shared drive).
- **Source Template:** `/flowcharts/client-workflow.drawio` (not tracked in git).
- **Regeneration:** Import the Draw.io file and export as PNG or SVG for client presentations when needed.

## Data Pipeline
- **Location:** Internal storage alongside data-processing SOPs.
- **Source Template:** `/flowcharts/data-pipeline.drawio` (not tracked in git).
- **Regeneration:** Illustrates ingestion → processing → QA → delivery; recreate using Mermaid or Draw.io using the documented process stages.

## Field to Delivery
- **Location:** Internal storage with field ops materials.
- **Source Template:** `/flowcharts/field-to-delivery.drawio` (not tracked in git).
- **Regeneration:** Highlight RTK calibration, data upload, QC, and final handoff. Use the SOPs in `docs/field-ops.md` and `docs/client-delivery.md` as step references.

> **Tip:** Prefer text-based diagrams (e.g., Mermaid in Markdown) for future contributions when possible. They remain diff-friendly and meet repository policies.
